    <pre> 
    My name is Michelle Nguyen but I prefer to go by Mich, pronounced Mish.
    I am currently 17 years old and will be turning 18 on May 27th.
    I am involved in a few activites at school: ASB, Varisty Volleyball
    Some  of my hobbies include: playing volleyball, makeup, singing in the shower and writing
    My favorite subject in school is English. (I suck at math)
    When I grow, I aspire to be a nurse partricioner and have a side job as a free-lance makeup artist.
    I enjoy hanging out with my friends and doing adventurous things such as hiking, kayaking, swimming etc.
    In life, I look forward to having a stable career, a happy family, a nice house, and many fancy cars.
    I also look forward to creating wondeful relationships with many people throughout my life. Two of my 
    greatest aspirations in life would be to travel the world and publish a book.
